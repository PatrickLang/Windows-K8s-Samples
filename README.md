## Acknowledgements

This is based on the samples from https://github.com/aspnet/Docs, specifically https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie

I added the README.md and scripts needed to build locally with Docker for Windows, then deploy on Kubernetes.


## Random Tips

- Greg Bayer has a good blog post on [Moving FIles from one Git Repository to Another, Preserving History](https://gbayer.com/development/moving-files-from-one-git-repository-to-another-preserving-history/) which I used to seed this repo with just the sample code, instead of the full .Net doc set :)
